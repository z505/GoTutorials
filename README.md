# GoTutorials
Simple Go lessons and examples to refer back to about language basics and language use.

When juggling multiple programming languages these days, you need a reference to come back to about one of your languages you use to remember what features it has. Great websites like DelphiBasics.co.uk for example describe the basics of Delphi.

This project is a start, to create some tutorials/lessons and examples about GoLang, to refer back to:
* if you (or I) forget about certain things in go and how it is done
* features comparison to C/Rust/Python/FPC/nimrod/C++/delphi etc.
* basic language use
* differences between object orientation and the way go structs work
* common things you should remember, but you forgot
* examples of simple use cases
* simplest way to do x
